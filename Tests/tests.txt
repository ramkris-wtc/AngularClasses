Build an app with the following functionality. 

1) It should recognize a few users.
2) A Login form that takes the user inside the app upon entering right credentials.
3) Once inside, the user can click on links and see data available only for registered users.
4) When a guest user attempts to view protected data, present him the login form.

A real world app like this requires a database setup and involves making calls to server side API.
For the purpose of this app, store users and all the other data in arrays inside your JS files.
The idea behind this exercise is to simulate the workflow that is common to majority of web apps.
